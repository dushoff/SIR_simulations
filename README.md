This was built as a stripped-down, robust simulator while at Princeton (Wilton sojourn). I hijacked it for a couple of things and then moved on. It could still be a good engine, with scaling-related helper functions. I think.

But where did I move on to? Where do I actually do SIR sims?? 2022 Apr 03 (Sun)

Trying to rebuild 2025 Feb 07 (Fri); who knows how well things are working?
