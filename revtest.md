I'm reasonably convinced now that backwards simulation works for means by reslicing, and that there is therefore no way to make it work for variances. We need to add things up by individual and then square. It looks like there should be no way to change the order of integration after that.

Pretty cool how well integrating backwards seems to work, though.
